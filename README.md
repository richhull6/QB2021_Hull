# Richard Hull and richhull@iu.edu

# I am a first-year doctorate student at IU and just graduated from the University of Georgia last May with a degree in ecology. My research interests are centered around botany, floristics, and biogeography. I am also an avid birder, am happily married, and don't like the cold Indiana winters.

# I want to learn GitHub

# I want to become more proficient at R

# I want to learn how to conduct various biodiversity analyses
